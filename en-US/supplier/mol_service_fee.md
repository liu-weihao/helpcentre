###  MOL Service Fee

MOL introduces the mature e-commerce model into the maritime industry. Suppliers are able to open their online stores to display their companies’ information, products and services for the convenience of the Buyers (primarily Shipowners) to search for the products/ services and place orders.

On the other hand, MOL strives to encourage the global Buyers (Shipowners) to send their RFQs online and supported by the qualified Suppliers who send the Quotations back to them. This in turn aids the Suppliers in getting new buyers and opening up new sales channels/ markets. After the Suppliers obtained the appointed orders in the system, MOL will require the Suppliers to pay a service fee based on the successful transaction’s amount in supporting the MOL’s platform operations. MOL follows the principle of “No Transaction No Fee”, Suppliers may use the platform’s functions and MOL will only collect the service fee from the Supplier upon successful appointed orders in the platform.

###  The Successful Transaction Between The Supplier And Buyer In MOL Platform

After the Supplier had sent the Quotation based on the RFQ (Request For Quotation) back to the Buyer, and the Quotation had been “Appointed” by the Buyer, this is considered as a transaction being transacted successfully in MOL’s platform. As a Supplier, you will need to pay a service fee for the successful transaction based on the amount displayed in the Quotation.

###  Service Fee For Unsuccessful Transaction After The Buyer Appointed The Supplier

For some special circumstances, if the Supplier’s Quotation had been “Appointed” by the Buyer but was unable to complete the transaction successfully, the Supplier will need to submit the supporting evidences/ documents etc. to prove that the transaction was unsuccessful between you and the Buyer at the MOL’s platform. MOL will review the supporting evidences/ documents etc. submitted, and only after verification, will exempt the service fee from the Supplier. If there are no supporting evidences/ documents etc. to prove that the transaction was unsuccessful in MOL’s platform, MOL will still define this as a successful transaction and the Supplier will still need to pay a service fee to MOL.
