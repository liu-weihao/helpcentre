###  RFQ And Quotation

As the RFQ may be send by the Buyers to more than one qualified Suppliers, and has limited validity period to quote, you will need to create your quotation within the time limit and offer competitive prices and payment terms to grab the business opportunity. You will receive the RFQs in your Order Management if you are qualified and selected by the buyers. You can search for the RFQs from MOL's homepage under Current Orders section > Select the platform’s tab, E.g. Ship Supply > Filter by Port and other required filters and click Search > Find the order > Quote Now.

###  RFQs That Unable To Quote

There are two reasons why you are unable to quote some RFQs;

Firstly, it will be based on your company registration’s Business Type and Ports Coverage. You will only be able to quote the RFQs based on these two criteria. For example, if your Business Type belongs to “Port Agency” and Port Coverage is “Singapore”, then you will only be able to quote the RFQs based these two criteria and not other types of RFQs that do not belong to these two criteria.

Secondly, the Buyers will be able to select their preferred Suppliers to send the RFQs. If you are not selected by the Buyers as their preferred Suppliers, then you will not be able to quote the RFQs.
