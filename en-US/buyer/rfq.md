###  Send A RFQ

MOL’s RFQ (Request For Quotation) had been designed to satisfy the Buyers (primarily Shipowners) maritime business operations, improve efficiency and productivity. The RFQ is a high-end request for quotation service which as a buyer, you will only need to fill up a simple request form specifying your requirements. MOL will send your RFQ automatically to the group of Suppliers whom match your requirements. You will be able to receive multiple quotations to compare the prices, payment terms and shortlist your supplier to complete the transaction. To make use of the RFQ Function, you may go to MOL’s homepage, under Marine Online’s logo > Click “Place an order” > Select the Platform to send the RFQ. Alternatively, you may go to the individual platform’s homepage by clicking “Send Enquiry/ Send RFQ/ Get a Quote/ Send Purchase Enquiry/ Add Cargo” (For Chartering platform only) to send the RFQ.

This can be one of the considering factors before you select the Supplier.
