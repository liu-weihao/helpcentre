###  Instruction Of Purchase

It will be a simple journey to purchase in MOL as a Buyer/ Shipowner. 

Before start using the functions in MOL, you will need to register for a free membership account and provide the supporting documents (a copy of your business license or its equivalent) to let us know that you are a serious buyer. After the verification had been completed, you will be able to start purchasing in MOL via 2 methods.

1.	You can submit a RFQ (Request for Quotation) by filling a simple enquiry form. MOL will notify all the qualified Suppliers to quote the Quotations for you, so you are able to compare the Quotations and ultimately appoint one Supplier who wins the chance to serve you based on the price, payment terms, supplier’s ratings and other factors. 

2.	We have thousands of Suppliers whom setup their company’s stores in MOL, so you are able to search for the Supplier, Product and Service you require and put into your shopping cart. You can make purchase directly if the Product/ Service is a fixed price item, otherwise you may send the order to the Supplier for the price enquiry and delivery details. You are able to pay and rate the Supplier after the delivery had been completed.  

For the payment method, it will depend on the Supplier’s payment terms offered to you. At some situations, you may need to pay in advance or make parts of the payment before your order will be confirmed.
