###  The Product/ Service that I received had problems, what do I do now?

If the Product/ Service was purchased from a third party Supplier, you will need to contact the Supplier regarding the problem. However if it cannot be resolved, you may contact our Customer Service for assistance. If the Product/ Service were purchased from MOL’s Direct Sale’s stores, you may contact our Customer Service who will be able to provide assistance on the issue.
