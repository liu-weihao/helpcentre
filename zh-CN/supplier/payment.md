## Payment

###  How do the Buyer makes payment to me?

The buyer can make payment to you based on the payment method you provided to them in the Quotation. You can liaise and arrange with the buyer on the payment method or term for the payment of the order.

###  The Buyer did not make payment to me based on the order, what should I do?

If the buyer did not make payment to you based on the agreed payment methods/ terms, you may contact the buyer directly on the overdue amount. If it cannot be resolved, you may contact our Customer Service who will be able to provide assistance on the issue. Refer to [Customer Service](http://aboutus.marineonline.com/docs/connect/contactus).

We highly recommend you to evaluate the credit levels of your buyers and provide the corresponding payment methods/ terms to control the risks. Alternatively, you can encourage the buyers to make payment via MOLâ€™s payment system which will protect you to receive the payment after your Products/ Services had been delivered to your buyers.
