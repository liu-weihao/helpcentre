###  Update Order Status

You do not need to update the order status as it is controlled by the system automatically based on the processes of each order. However, for the Order Management - Appointed/ Processing  status order and Shopping Cart Order - New/ Processing status order, you will need to update the tracking status for the delivery and payment progress for your Buyers. 

**For Order Management status:**

You can update the delivery and payment status to the Buyers under Order Management. Go to My MOL > Order > My Offer > Appointed/ Processing tab > Click Update Status. 

**For Shopping Cart Order status:**

You can update the delivery and payment status to the Buyers under Shopping Cart Order. Go to My MOL > Order > My Order > New/ Processing tab > Click Update Status. 

Following are the types of statuses:

-	Delivery status: Handling, On Delivery, Delivered 

    Note: Delivered status is updated automatically by the system when Buyer clicks "Confirm Delivery" under Appointed and Processing tabs.
 
-	Payment status : Unpaid, Partially Paid, Paid
